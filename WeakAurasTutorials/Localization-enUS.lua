L["Create a Display Text"] = [=[Although the Display tab has sliders to control Width, Height, and X and Y positioning, there is an easier way to move and size your display.

You can simply click and drag your display to anywhere on your screen, and click and drag the corners to change the size.

You can also press Shift to hide the mover/sizer frame, for more accurate placement.]=]
L["Activation Settings: 1/5"] = "Activation Settings: 1/5"

A display whose Load settings are not satisfied will basically not exist to WeakAuras; it will never be visible, and its Trigger will never even be tested.

Using the Load tab will help you organize displays between different characters and talent specializations. It also helps keep WeakAuras efficient; the less displays that are Loaded when they do not need to be, the less work WeakAuras has to do figuring out whether or not they should be visible.]=]

Multi-target Auras triggers are different from normal Aura triggers because they are based on Combat Log events, which means they will track auras on mobs that nobody is targeting (although some dynamic information is not available without someone in your group targeting the unit).
